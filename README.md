# Attendance-Monitoring-System
This is a project built using Python and Tkinter, which simulates the process of marking attendance using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology. The system is designed to mark a student's attendance by scanning their RFID ID's (Student ID Card). The records are displayed on screen in a GUI.
