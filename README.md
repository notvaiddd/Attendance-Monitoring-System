# Attendance-Monitoring-System
This is a project built using Python and Tkinter, which simulates the process of marking attendance using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology. The system is designed to mark a student's attendance by scanning their RFID ID's (Student ID Card). The records are displayed on screen in a GUI.

# Features:
RFID Simulation: Simulates the RFID scanning process by allowing users to enter a studentâ€™s RFID tag.
Attendance Logging: Automatically records attendance with the student's name and current date and time.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, the interface is clean, colorful, and professional, making it easy to navigate.
Attendance Records Display: Displays the attendance records directly on the screen.
Clear Attendance: Offers an option to reset the attendance records.
Error Handling: Includes notifications for invalid or unrecognized RFID tags.

# Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used to build the logic of the system.
Tkinter: For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the system.
